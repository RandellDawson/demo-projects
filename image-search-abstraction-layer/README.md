This project should fulfill all the user stories referenced in [Build an Image Search Abstraction Layer project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-an-image-search-abstraction-layer).  We do not have access to the [heroku version](https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/), so this demo should be a completely new version instead of a duplicate of the original.
